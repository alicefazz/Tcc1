\begin{resumo}[Abstract]

This work presents a study about the Adomian Decomposition Method (ADM) applied to the Bioheat Transfer Equation or Pennes' Bioheat Transfer Equation. The ADM is explained in an educational manner, presenting several examples of its application. Besides, the Pennesâ€™ thermal model in a stationary regime, one-dimensional at the cylindrical coordinates was approximately solved by the MDA.



 
 
   \textbf{Key-words}:  Adomian Decomposition Method, Bioheat Transfer Equation, Pennes' Bioheat Transfer Equation.
